# Mission Control

Command center for agent orchestration — manage work, review & gate, and observe live activity.
Mission Control is the dashboard layer for Jay's OpenClaw setup ("the empire"): scheduled runs,
agents, approvals, and real-time activity, rendered as a dark-first, design-token-driven web app.

**Status:** foundation live — Overview screen with a real WebSocket activity feed fed by OpenClaw itself.

---

## What this is

Mission Control is a **Turborepo monorepo** with two apps:

| App | Path | Stack | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `web` | `apps/web` | React 19 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS v4 | Dashboard UI (Overview + Live Activity band today; Tasks, Agents, Approvals, Health… on the roadmap) |
| `api` | `apps/api` | NestJS 11 + Socket.IO + Prisma 7 (pg adapter) | Backend: health probe, WebSocket event bus, external event intake, Postgres persistence |

The wiring is deliberately simple at this stage: **the web app connects to the API over a
Socket.IO WebSocket and renders whatever typed events the API broadcasts.** OpenClaw pushes
real activity into the API through a small token-protected ingest endpoint, so the dashboard
shows genuinely live events (scheduled runs, agent work, health ticks) — never fake data.

```

### Event flow (the Live Activity feed)

1. **Producers** — OpenClaw (via the cron bridge job) POSTs a typed event to
   `POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/events` with an `x-ingest-token` header.
2. **Ingest** — `IngestController` validates the token and the event type against a
   closed union (`run.started`, `run.completed`, `run.failed`, `health.tick`, `hello`);
   unknown types are rejected (400), unauthenticated requests fail closed (401).
3. **Gateway** — `LiveActivityGateway` broadcasts the event to every connected socket
   client with a server timestamp.
4. **Dashboard** — `useLiveActivity` (a React hook in `apps/web`) subscribes with
   `socket.io-client`, keeps the most recent 50 events, and renders them in the
   Live Activity band with a stable per-type color map. Connection state drives an
   honest green/red status dot in the topbar — no fake "online".
5. **Heartbeat** — `HealthTickerService` broadcasts `health.tick` every 30 s
   (`HEALTH_TICK_MS`, `0` disables) so the feed always has current, real data.

### API surface

| Endpoint | Transport | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | HTTP | Liveness + readiness: `status` (`ok`/`degraded`), uptime, connected socket clients, real DB connectivity. Never fakes 100%. |
| `POST /events` | HTTP | Event intake for trusted producers (OpenClaw). Guarded by `INGEST_TOKEN` (fail-closed in production). |
| Socket.IO `/` | WS | Live feed: server-authoritative typed events with `ts` timestamps. Production requires `SOCKET_TOKEN` in the handshake. |

### Data model (Prisma 7, Postgres)

- **`Run`** — scheduled runs / jobs the dashboard observes (`Morning Brief`, `Trend Radar`, …):
  `name`, `status` (`queued | running | done | failed`), `startedAt`, `finishedAt`.
- **`Agent`** — the agent roster with color-coding used across the UI: `name` (unique), `color`
  (design-token values: `purple | amber | green | teal`).

Migrations are a security red line in this project: schema changes are human-reviewed and
never auto-applied by the app. In dev, `npx prisma db push` syncs the schema.

### Security posture (hard requirement)

- **Loopback only** — the API binds `127.0.0.1` by default (`HOST` env overrides); it is never
  exposed publicly without explicit intent. The Vite dev server is loopback too.
- **Fail-closed auth** — production refuses to boot without `DATABASE_URL`; the socket rejects
  handshakes without a valid `SOCKET_TOKEN`; ingest rejects requests without a valid `INGEST_TOKEN`.
- **Locked CORS** — both the HTTP layer and the WebSocket handshake are locked to `WEB_ORIGIN`
  (default `http://localhost:5173`); never a wildcard.
- **No secrets in code** — all env values come from `.env` (git-ignored) / deploy env. See
  `apps/api/.env.example` for the shape.

## Running locally

Prereqs: Node 20+ (tested on 26), npm, Postgres 16.

```bash
# 1. Install + generate Prisma client
npm install
cd apps/api && npx prisma generate

# 2. Postgres: create the dev database
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE mission_control;"

# 3. Sync schema (dev only; migrations stay human-reviewed)
cd apps/api && npx prisma db push

# 4. Env files (see apps/api/.env.example; never commit real values)
#    apps/api/.env ← DATABASE_URL, PORT, WEB_ORIGIN, SOCKET_TOKEN, INGEST_TOKEN, HEALTH_TICK_MS
#    apps/web/.env  ← optional VITE_API_URL (default http://localhost:3000)

# 5. Run both apps
npm run dev        # turbo: api (nest start --watch) + web (vite) in parallel
```

Verify: `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/health` → `{"status":"ok",...,"database":"connected"}`,
then open **http://localhost:5173** — the topbar dot should be green and the Live Activity
band fills with `hello`, periodic `health.tick`, and OpenClaw-run events.

### Build / test / lint

```bash
npm run build      # turbo build (tsc + vite + nest)
npm test           # jest (api)
npm run lint
```

## OpenClaw integration

Mission Control is fed by the OpenClaw instance on the same box. A cron job (isolated agent
turn, every 5 minutes) summarizes recent real activity — sessions, scheduled runs, notable
tool work — and POSTs it to the ingest endpoint:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/events \
  -H "content-type: application/json" -H "x-ingest-token: $INGEST_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"type":"run.completed","payload":{"name":"Trend Radar","status":"done"}}'
```

The feed is transport-agnostic: any trusted producer can push the same typed events.

---

## Dev workflow (mandatory)

- **No direct merges to `main`** — everything lands via PR, reviewed by Jay. (Exception:
  hotfixes + docs explicitly requested by Jay, e.g. the Aug 10 bring-up commit.)
- **Merge → delete branch** — immediately after a PR merges, delete the source branch
  (local AND remote). No lingering branches; `main` is the only long-lived branch.
- PRs are kept small (2–3 logical PRs per feature batch) for readability.
- Heavy inline comments on all new code.
- Run the development skills before committing: `vibe-dev-workflow` (PLAN/ACT, Design Doc,
  LOG.md, acceptance checklist) and `task-development-workflow` (TDD, task tracking, PR review).
- Security red lines: auth, DB schema, secrets are human-reviewed line by line.

## Roadmap

1. ✅ `feat/1-web-scaffold` — monorepo + shell + tokens + Overview
2. ✅ `feat/2-api-foundation` — NestJS, Socket.IO gateway, Prisma schema, health
3. ✅ `feat/3-live-feed` — web ↔ socket wiring, real activity feed
4. ✅ OpenClaw feed — ingest endpoint + health ticker + cron bridge (Aug 10)
5. 🔜 Tasks / Agents screens, run persistence, approvals, Trend Radar
