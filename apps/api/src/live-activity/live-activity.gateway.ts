 * events (scheduled run status, agent state changes, health ticks) without
 * polling. This is the transport PR 3 wires the frontend into.
 *
 * Security (vibe-dev-workflow red lines — GLM review 🔴 #2):
 *  - In production (NODE_ENV=production), connections WITHOUT a valid
 *    SOCKET_TOKEN in the handshake are rejected at connect time. This guard
 *    makes it impossible to accidentally ship an open socket.
 *  - In dev, connections are allowed freely (localhost only by default).
 *  - The gateway only emits server-authored events; it never echoes
 *    client-supplied payloads.
